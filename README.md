# Bikesharing/Citibank Challenge

## Overview

### Purpose

The purpose of our original investigation was to find out if a citibike branch in Des Moines was viable, which it was. While digging through the data I noticed something odd though. There was a small contingent of people who were riding their bike after midnight. This got me curious and I began to question who these mystery people were and if they were in line with the rest of the data available.

## Results

### Night Owls

I used Tableu to visualize my data and it painted a picture for me. I created a story with my graphs that is available here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/hayden.wallace/viz/CitiBikeChallenge_16629536743590/ChallengeStory?publish=yes

For those who are not fans of external links I will continue the story below:

The first graph was a general probe of the times that people ride, with me pointing out that there are people riding after midnight.

The second graph was a more detailed view of the midnight to 2AM scene and what it looked like business-wise.

The third graph was a different way to map the first two, but one that backed up my findings so far.

The fourth graph broke down the riders by gender, of which the group was overwhelmingly male. I decided to focus on this.

The fifth graph broke down riding throughout the week by gender, reinforcing that men were primarily the ones riding late but also showing that the weekends were the only time that people were really riding around the midnight mark.

The 6th graph broke down the entirety of the userbase of citibike down, showing that our current findings made sense in regards to the rest of the data, because there were mostly males riding citibikes anyway.

The 7th and final graph confirmed the fact that citibike's userbase was mostly men and then added the fact that they were mostly subscribers as well.

## Summary

### Analysis and Future Analysis

I ultimately learned that the night owls were just a group of men who liked to ride their bike a little later than most. This was consistent with the rest of the data that I had gathered, which stated that most of citibike's base was male subscribers. A dead end, but one that I'm glad I chased. In the future I would like to do two futher analyses on the data at hand. I would like to gather more than just a month's worth of data and see if the male/female demographic shifted at any point, or if it shifts throughout the year. I would also like to see the areas that stay active during the colder months, which I imagine are real hotspots for the business.
